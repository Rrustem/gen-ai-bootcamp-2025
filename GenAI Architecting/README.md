GenAI Bootcamp w/Andrew Brown


## Functional Requirements
The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure because there's a concern about the privacy of users data and also a concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI will greatly raise in cost.

They want to invest in an AI PC where they can  afford spend 10 - 15K.
They have 300 active students who are located within the city of Nagasaki.


## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerfull enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10 - 15K.

We're just going to hook up a single serve in our office to the Internet and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students.


## Data Strategy

There is a concern of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.
